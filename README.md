# An Analysis of reported crimes in Vancouver 
This is a repository for team project of DANA.Our team will be using this for version control and coordination.  

# Objective

To determine the effects that year, neighbourhood, time of day, and type of crime have on the crimes reported
in Vancouver.
Has crime in Vancouver increased or decreased over fifteen years? Are there neighbourhoods that should be
avoided due to particularly high crime rates? What times of day and types of crime should people be most
alert for? These are important questions for any Vancouver resident, and this project attempts to determine
the answers to this question.
